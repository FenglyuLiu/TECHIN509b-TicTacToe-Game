# techin509b-TicTacToe_with_OOP
TicTacToe Project, Lab Assignment for week 7

Now that you have a working Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need to add additional functionality to the game through the OOP concepts learned in class. 

Add the following additional features to the game, which will need to leverage object oriented programming.

Currently, the game supports the following capabilities:

The players are initialized with an empty board. 
The two players should be able to input their moves into the Python CLI by taking turns.
When there is a viable winner, the game ends and the winner is announced. 
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until either of the players wins or when it is a draw.
The additional features to be added are:`

The game should be playable by a single player or 2 players. 
In the case of a single player, the player should play against a 'bot'. For implementing this bot, you can just choose feasible random numbers as the inputs to the game from the bot (you can build more sophisticated logic for the inputs from the bots if you are interested). 
In the case of two players, the players should take turns entering the inputs in the CLI. 
The functionality should be implemented through objected-oriented dependency injection.
The above steps are repeated until a winner emerges.
