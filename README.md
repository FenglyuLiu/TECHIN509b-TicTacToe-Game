# COURSE DESCRIPTION 

This course enables students to build software and perform basic statistical analysis in Python. Students will learn to use a development environment based on Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub.

In the first half of the course, students will learn fundamental concepts of the Python language: data structures, flow control, and functions. Next, they will learn common software engineering techniques, including version control, debugging with stack traces, object oriented programming, and testing.

In the second half of the course, students will develop and application that allows them to practice their Python and software engineering skills while producing data. Students will leverage popular packages in the scientific computing python stack—Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy—to perform data analysis, visualization, and manipulation of their data.

# STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the end of this course students should:

Feel confident building applications in Python
Understand basic test-driven and collaborative software development techniques
Have accurate expectations about what can be built in Python
Know how to leverage the scientific computing stack in Python to perform analyses
Be comfortable navigating Python documentation
Be able to navigate the command line
Be able to use collaborative tools like git and GitHub
Develop in a variety of environments like Jupyter and VS Code
Throughout the course, students will develop a simple turn-based game played on a 2D grid and playable in the terminal. They will also perform statistical analysis of games played, and visualize this analysis.
